# 📊 Live Sales Intelligence Dashboard

**A Full-Stack Data Application for Retail Analytics.**

This project demonstrates a complete **ETL (Extract, Transform, Load)** pipeline built with Python. It ingests raw, messy sales data (CSV), automates the cleaning process using Pandas, and visualizes real-time profit margins via an interactive Streamlit interface.
